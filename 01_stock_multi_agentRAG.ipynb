    "# Course Overview: From Novice to Multi-Agent RAG System Builder\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is designed to be a hands-on, project-based learning experience. We'll start with the foundational concepts and progressively build a sophisticated, yet manageable, multi-agent system that can help you analyze financial news and generate stock ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning Objectives:\n",
    "* Understand the fundamentals of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and multi-agent systems.\n",
    "* Master the core components of LangGraph, including state, nodes, and edges.\n",
    "* Develop a multi-agent RAG system for a real-world application.\n",
    "* Integrate external tools, such as a financial news API, into your system.\n",
    "* Implement a Model Context Protocol (MCP) interaction for structured agent communication.\n",
    "* Gain proficiency in building and debugging AI applications in a Jupyter Notebook environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Project: A Financial News Analysis and Stock Idea Generator\n",
    "We'll build a multi-agent system that takes a stock ticker as input and outputs a concise analysis and a potential trading idea. This project will involve three specialized agents working together:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The News Researcher Agent: This agent's job is to find the latest financial news for a given stock. This is the \"Retrieval\" part of our RAG system.\n",
    "2. The Data Analyst Agent: This agent will take the news articles, analyze the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral), and summarize the key information.\n",
    "3. The Trading Idea Generator Agent: This agent will receive the structured analysis from the Data Analyst and, based on the sentiment and news summary, will generate a brief, actionable trading idea.\n"

    "* Setting Up Your Environment: We'll start by configuring your VS Code with the necessary Python extensions for Jupyter Notebooks. You'll learn how to create a virtual environment to manage your project's dependencies.\n",
    "* Introduction to RAG and Multi-Agent Systems: A high-level overview of what these concepts mean and why they are powerful for building intelligent applications.\n",
    "* \"Hello, LangGraph!\": We'll write your first simple LangGraph application to understand the basic workflow."
