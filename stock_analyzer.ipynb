    "# Course Overview: From Novice to Multi-Agent RAG System Builder\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is designed to be a hands-on, project-based learning experience. We'll start with the foundational concepts and progressively build a sophisticated, yet manageable, multi-agent system that can help you analyze financial news and generate stock ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning Objectives:\n",
    "* Understand the fundamentals of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and multi-agent systems.\n",
    "* Master the core components of LangGraph, including state, nodes, and edges.\n",
    "* Develop a multi-agent RAG system for a real-world application.\n",
    "* Integrate external tools, such as a financial news API, into your system.\n",
    "* Implement a Model Context Protocol (MCP) interaction for structured agent communication.\n",
    "* Gain proficiency in building and debugging AI applications in a Jupyter Notebook environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Project: A Financial News Analysis and Stock Idea Generator\n",
    "We'll build a multi-agent system that takes a stock ticker as input and outputs a concise analysis and a potential trading idea. This project will involve three specialized agents working together:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The News Researcher Agent: This agent's job is to find the latest financial news for a given stock. This is the \"Retrieval\" part of our RAG system.\n",
    "2. The Data Analyst Agent: This agent will take the news articles, analyze the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral), and summarize the key information.\n",
    "3. The Trading Idea Generator Agent: This agent will receive the structured analysis from the Data Analyst and, based on the sentiment and news summary, will generate a brief, actionable trading idea.\n"

    "1. Install VS Code: If you haven't already, download and install Visual Studio Code.\n",
    "2. Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed. You can get it from the official Python website.\n",
    "3. Install VS Code Extensions: Open VS Code, go to the Extensions view (the icon with four squares on the sidebar), and install the Python and Jupyter extensions by Microsoft.\n",
    "4. Create a Project Folder: Create a new folder on your computer named LangGraph-Stock-Analyzer.\n",
    "5. Open in VS Code: Open this folder in VS Code (File > Open Folder...).\n",
    "6. Create a Virtual Environment:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   conda create -n stock-analyzer-env python=3.11\n",
    "   conda activate stock-analyzer-env\n",

    "Introduction to Key Concepts\n",
    "* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Imagine you're a financial analyst. You don't just give stock advice from memory; you first retrieve relevant documents like news reports and SEC filings, and then you use that information to generate your analysis. RAG systems work the same way. They first fetch information from a data source (like a news API) and then use a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate an informed response.\n",
    "* Multi-Agent Systems: Instead of one single program trying to do everything, we can create a team of specialized \"agents.\" In our project, we'll have a \"Researcher\" agent to get news, an \"Analyst\" agent to interpret it, and an \"Idea Generator\" agent to suggest trades. They work together, each handling one part of the task.\n",
    "* LangGraph: This is our toolkit for managing the team of agents. It allows us to define a workflow, or \"graph,\" that dictates who does what and in what order. It's like a project manager for our AI agents, ensuring they work together smoothly and maintain a shared understanding of the task through a \"state.\""
